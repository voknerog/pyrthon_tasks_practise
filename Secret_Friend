Write a program that randomly assigns each student a secret friend to work with them on programming problems.

Input data format
The input to the program in the first line is the number nn - the total number of students. Next come nn lines containing the names and surnames of the students.

Output format
The program should output the student's first and last name (according to source order) and the secret friend's first and last name, separated by a hyphen.

Note 1. Please note that you cannot be a secret friend to yourself and you cannot be a secret friend to several students.

Note 2: The tests below are only examples of a possible answer. There are other ways to choose secret friends.

l = [input() for i in range(int(input()))]
random.shuffle(l)
for i in range(len(l)):
    print(f'{l[i]} - {l[(i + 1) % len(l)]}')
